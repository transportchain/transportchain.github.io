Each country/jurisdiction have their own laws and regulations governing the cooperation of pilots, airlines, mechanics, aircraft manufacturers, etc.. This makes building a conventional solution for everyone close to impossible. Each jurisdiction or civil aviation authority will want full transparency and absolute control which is very hard to provide by an enterprise software solution built and maintained by a conventional company or even a consortium/non-profit.\nBlockchain with an on-chain governance by participants caters to all these needs.\nTransparency The goal is to have absolute transparency when it comes to data alterations, financial transactions, the technology stack itself, and the rules governing the interactions of the participants of the blockchain. The blockchain itself provides means to have full transaction history performed, this covers the data and state operations as well as any financial transactions done on the blockchain. The project will be completely open source and any interested party granted, after securing an appropriate slot, can run a compiled from source code validator. As for the transparency of governing rules and mechanisms, a complete on-chain governance solution will be implemented which will allow participants and regulators to transparently manage and alter the rulebook governing the operation of the blockchain.\nGovernance Changes to the way the blockchain operates are inevitable. This can be easily seen by the number of forks Bitcoin has as of today. Forking however is an inefficient, costly and hard to integrate with mechanism of introducing updates. As a replacement to forking or otherwise centralized control on-chain governance of the blockchain is gaining significant support in the blockchain community.\nOn-chain governance is an effective model of blockchain control and feature updates which ensures full transparency of the process and makes sure that all participants of the blockchain can vote on the introduced changes. This makes the chain in a sense a true democracy without one defined owner but rather being owned by the participants themselves.\nIn the future when regulators join the chain certain decision-making and changes affecting their jurisdictions or otherwise belonging in the regulator domain of authority can be isolated only to them. This will allow regulators to make regulatory decisions without the regular chain participant or token holder affecting the outcome of the vote.\nAs of today on-chain governance has been successfully implemented in a number of blockchain ecosystems and is considered proven technology. Polkadot \u0026 Cosmos are just a couple examples of successful proof-of-stake blockchains with on-chain governance.\nDifferences in various jurisdictions \u0026 functionality customization Different jurisdictions have regulations which differ from each other. Thankfully the differences are not that significant and generally follow the same rules. Our goal is to integrate the jurisdictions and processes specific to them into the blockchain. This will require integration processes for each of the jurisdictions then will be available on chain with customisations.\nAnother aspect of the project is that it’s open source in nature and any jurisdiction and its managing authority are free to implement changes on the blockchain. Those changes, after passing through all technical stages, will undergo a vote of the governing body of the chain and after that will be applied to all participants.\nIntegration with aviation authorities Many processes and paperwork for some of the countries and aviation jurisdiction can be moved to transportchain. These processes include but are not limited to the issuance of airworthiness certificates and their renewal, having a public registry of all registered aircraft, airline ticket sales, etc..\nThe transportchain team has spoken with some civil aviation authorities integrations however will have to wait till the chain being at the stage where a stable and functional testnet is available.\nA separate blockchain solution The project being powered by a separate blockchain allows for complete flexibility in the solutions we build. The core components of transportchain such as licenses, certificates, vehicles, aircraft and various other entities that will live on the chain will be implemented in the blockchain architecture itself. The lifecycle of said core components and management will also be implemented as core functionality of the blockchain and will be available via specifically designed transaction types. Later on, when the core functionality of the blockchain passes proper testing, support for smart contracts will be enabled which will allow third parties to develop their own additions to the functionality already available on transportchain.\n","wordCount":"727","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://transportchain.io/papermod-cover.png","datePublished":"2022-07-09T00:49:23+04:00","dateModified":"2022-07-09T00:49:23+04:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://transportchain.io/page/technology/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"TransportChain","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://transportchain.io/images/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://transportchain.io/ accesskey=h title="TransportChain (Alt + H)"><img src=https://transportchain.io/images/logo-transparent.png alt aria-label=logo height=30>TransportChain</a><div class=logo-switches></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://transportchain.io/#plans title=Roadmap><span>Roadmap</span></a></li><li><a href=https://transportchain.io/page/technology title=Technology><span class=active>Technology</span></a></li><li><a href=https://transportchain.io/page/contact title="Contact Us"><span>Contact Us</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Technology</h1></header><div class=post-content><p>The transportation industry, especially aviation, is one of the most regulated industries in the world.
