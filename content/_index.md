We at TransportChain strongly believe that the modern transportation industry, particularly the aviation, boating, and automotive sectors, will greatly benefit from the widespread adoption of a blockchain-based data ledger. That is especially true for the heavily regulated and bureaucratic aviation industry, where many processes and certifications can be moved to a blockchain medium which in turn will enable faster processing and readily available information with verified sources and dates.

### Plans
The project's focus for 2022 and 2023 will be on general aviation and regional airlines. The rough roadmap will be:

**2022**
 - Aircraft management
 - Pilot profile management
 - Flight log management
 - Aircraft mechanic and maintenance shop management
 - Aircraft maintenance log management
  
**2023**
 - Small or regional airline ticket selling auction
 - Release of the codebase with an open-source license
 - Launch of the TransportChain's public testnet
