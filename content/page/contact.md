## Development Contribution

The project is currently in closed source mode and will continue like this until the release of the first working component for testing purposes. However, regardless of the closed source aspect of the current codebase we are ready to discuss possible contributions be that organizational, business domain expertise or work on the codebase itself. If you are interested in the project and want to be a part of it let us know at **[collaboration@transportchain.io](mailto:collaboration@transportchain.io)**.
